# Powerlifting

## Introduction 
This repo contains a small amount of data analysis that aims to answer if women powerlifters in the IPF are getting stronger. 

## Data
All the data was taken from <a href="https://www.openpowerlifting.org/">Open Powerlifting</a>. Please note that this cut of the data is not maintained and so there is only data  until July 2020. <br /> This data can be found in the data folder.

## Going forward
This piece of analysis is quite elementry and it would be good to revisit this piece of work to improve the analysis and make the conclusion stronger
